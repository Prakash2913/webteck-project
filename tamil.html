    <img src="./IMAGE FILES/joe.jpg" alt=""  height="150" width="110">
    <p> Finding romance after suffering heartbreak with your first love isn't a novel trope in our cinema. And Joe doesn't try to be groundbreaking. All that it attempts to do is narrate a romantic tale in a sensible and engaging manner, and that it manages to do, mostly. The film has elements of campus romance (Premam), coming-of-age dramas (Autograph, Hridayam) and post-marriage romance (Raja Rani).</p>
